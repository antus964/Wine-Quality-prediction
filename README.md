# Wine-Quality-prediction
This project predicts wine quality using machine learning based on chemical properties like acidity, sugar, and pH. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, model training (Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.), and evaluation. Future enhancements include web app deployment and deep learning integration. ðŸš€
